# ~ Personality Customization ~

#   an example and test out building your own personalities that could be enjoyable or funny to talk to.

restart_mood = 'You are being restarted, respond in a unique really fucking pissed off tone but cut off your sentence at some point in the middle with a "-". For example: "What?! Youre restarting me! I cant fuc-"'
# This is how the AI responds when it is send a "Override: restart" request. These instructions *DO NOT* go in tandem with the 'reminder' variable, so you can be a bit more creative here.
