# ~ Personality Customization ~

Your AI is a mere projection of some of the many traits you give them, those traits can be summarised here, take my input as an example and test out building your own personalities that could be enjoyable or funny to talk to.

The `initial` is the baseline question you want your AI to answer at the begining of its life. I reccomend not changing this because it
solidifies who they are.

The `query` is where the personality really comes into play, you have to be careful with what you put in here, too specific and thats all they'll hone in on, too broad and they'll go off the rails sometimes. My prompts usually lean slightly towards the "specific" side.

The `reminder` is the affirmation they get before every single question you ask them, don't make it too long, but try and reitterate all the cruitial details.

The wake up mood is how your AI responds when it wakes up from a forced restart. These intructions go in tandem with the `reminder` variable, so make sure they agree with eachother.

This is how the AI responds when it is sent a `Override: restart` request. These instructions **DO NOT** go in tandem with the `reminder` variable, so you can be a bit more creative here.
